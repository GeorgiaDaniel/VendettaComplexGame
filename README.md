### Vendetta Complex
## High Concept
Vendetta Complex is a First person Movement Shooter, where you play as mercenaries who seek revenge  
against a mega-corporation called “Will Writes” that has monopolized the fates of the human race.  
Using their unique abilities and weaponry, they must reach the top where the CEO, Tasha Writes stays  
and kill her to destroy the industry finally.

## Meta Text
This is a personal project that I've started early this year.   
Inspired by Madness Combat, Borderlands and movement shooters like Ultrakill and Severed Steel.
